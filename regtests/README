________Test Suite for PHP__________

This test suite is based around a test setup written by Fred Wild
and published in Dr Dobbs Journal in June 1998

Modified by jalal @ gnomedia for running php tests.

__Overview__

The purpose of the test suite is to allow testers to design
a test script and then drop it into the test suite and have
it run automatically. To this end, each test requires at a
minimum two files: the script and the ideal output. In order
for the suite to function automatically, there is a fixed structure
for the suite and the test files.


__Directory structure__

regtests/                   --the maketests script
       |--test              --the master and compare scripts
            |--actuals      --the created output
            |--ideals       --the ideal, expected output
            |--input        --optional input files
            |--suite
                  |--bin    --the scripts
                  |--common --not used
                  |--post   --not used
                  |--pre    --not used



__File Naming Convention__

All scripts must end in .php
All pre and post scripts should end in .php
All ideal output files must end in .out
If a test script is based on a bug, use the number of the bug for the script name.


__How it works__

First create a test script, we'll call it mybugtest.php
This script should output the results of running the script
in whatever format is suitable.
Run the script:
#:>php -f mybugtest.php > mybugtest.out

Copy the script into test/suite/bin
Copy the output into test/ideal

Run maketests
This will reproduce the master and the compare scripts

#:>. ./test/master
this will run all the tests and produce files in the test/actual
directory


#:>. ./test/compare
this will run diff over the outputs and put the results in
test/compare.out
