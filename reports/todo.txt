Reports per week :
SELECT VERSION,COUNT(id),  YEAR(DATE),WEEK(DATE) FROM reports 
GROUP BY VERSION,YEAR(DATE),WEEK(DATE)

If we have time : graph to see reports sent by version and by date

use http://svn.php.net/viewvc/web/php/trunk/include/version.inc?view=co

Improve documentation functions, syntax, etc.

Vote : should env config in /reports/ be hidden to everyone except logged in php accounts ?
       2) blacklist robots with meta ?
